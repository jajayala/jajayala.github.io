## Favortie CPSC 120L Labs

Lab 4, Part 2
This was one of my favorite labs because we got to make a type of game and one of my first games. Also the if statements were introduced into this lab and are one of my favorites to use. We had to guess what the secret number was and it fascinates me that one piece of code like the if statement can be used anywhere. 

Lab 5, Part 1
This lab was also one of my favorites because we were able to calculate the area of a rectangle. This lab was a little challenging at the moment when my partner and I were working on it because we weren't sure how to have actions or questions in one statement. Overall it was very fascinating that our code when inputted numbers can calculate the area of a rectangle but also if you don't input any number the code doesn't work. 

Lab 6, Part 1
This was also one of my favorite labs because I found it a bit funny and just fun to make. We were able to make a sandwich when we would provide 3 inputs as answers and then it would write a sentence saying what our order is. When I think about it, this is used in a lot of restaurants and the code we make right now can be used in many other real life scenarios.
